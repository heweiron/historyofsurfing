<h1>A history of surfing</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The art of surfing, known as heʻe ʻana (heʻe means to surf, and ʻana is the nominalizing particle) in the Hawaiian
  language, was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard HMS Endeavour during the first voyage of James Cook, during the ship's
  stay in Tahiti. Surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture and predates European contact. The chief
  (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood.
  The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but
  they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.</p>

<p>In Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often
  paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling
  head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied surfing parties and the men would often swap
  between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing
  became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.</p>

<p>The sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed
  Samoans surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as fa'ase'e or se'egalu. Edward
  Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing
  was also practiced in Tonga, where the late king Taufa'ahau Tupou IV was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.</p>
